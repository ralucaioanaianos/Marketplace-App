The Dream Closet website is a simple online marketplace. Users can list items they want to sell by filling out a form with details like the item name, photo name, gender, and available sizes. Once submitted, the item is added to a list of items available for sale.

Overall, my project provides a basic framework for an online marketplace, allowing users to easily list items for sale. It is a user-friendly platform for buying and selling goods online.

The application is deployed and has the following address: https://marketplace-app-kappa.vercel.app/
